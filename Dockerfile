# If you need to access your private repository, you'll need to add ssh keys to the image
# and configure SSH to use them. You can do this in following way:
# ADD gh-repo-key /
# RUN \
#   chmod 600 /gh-repo-key && \
#   echo "IdentityFile /gh-repo-key" >> /etc/ssh/ssh_config

# In your image based on this one you will have to run this script:
RUN . /build-typo3-app/pre-install-typo3-app.sh
